# Reading List

## Why?
In a world with fragmented information it is difficult to find good resources to study learn and keep growing. Many times you might spend hours finding the correct resources to learn about a topic instead of focusing on the learning itself. This `repo` focuses on creating a shared common pool of books/articles/papers... about the tech world. 

## What?
This Reading list will mostly focus on the tech world, from data structures to more high level concepts. It is a malleable repo which outcomes are yet to define

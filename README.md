# Reading List

## Why?
In a world with fragmented information it is difficult to find good resources to study learn and keep growing. Many times you might spend hours finding the correct resources to learn about a topic instead of focusing on the learning itself. This `repo` focuses on creating a shared common pool of books/articles/papers... about the tech world. 

## What?
This Reading list will mostly focus on the tech world, from data structures to more high level concepts. It is a malleable repo which outcomes are yet to define

## Structure
The idea for now is to divide the project into macro categories with subcategories inside. The idea yet is to not create too many categories as this will be harder to find a resource than and the project will loose scope. The categories for now are:
- Math
- ProgrammingLanguages
- GeneralTech
- Swe
- ArtificialIntelligence
- AlgorithmsDataStrutures

Feel free to add suggestions on how to better organize the system
